# QuantumCryptography
Lab C TAU Course
This repository contains our experiments results and codes used to analyze and simulate them. 
Content:
The results of the experiment are written in the Excel file: Quantum Cryptography mes.xlsx
The code that reads the results and calculates the needed statistics: countin_better.mlx
The data should be imported to the matlab code as shown in: mes_for_matlab.xlsx
To choose the random bases and bits we used a python code: main.py
The simulation written in python is: Simulation.py
